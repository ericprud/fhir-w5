The sequence information shall be provided enumerating the amino acids from N- to C-terminal end using standard single-letter amino acid codes. Uppercase shall be used for L-amino acids and lowercase for D-amino acids. Transcribed SubstanceProteins will always be described using the translated sequence; for synthetic peptide containing amino acids that are not represented with a single letter code an X should be used within the sequence. The modified amino acids will be distinguished by their position in the sequence.:
